### UDP 

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that allows data to be sent without establishing a connection between sender and receiver. It is fast and efficient but does not guarantee delivery, order, or error checking. UDP is commonly used for streaming, gaming, and real-time applications where speed is more important than reliability.

### TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data between sender and receiver. It establishes a connection before transmitting data and uses error checking, acknowledgments, and retransmissions to guarantee delivery. TCP is used for applications where reliability is critical, such as web browsing, email, and file transfers.
