# Where to start

## What is Data science? 

By turning many observations into numbers we can Ô¨Åt
equations to them, or learn relationships between them,
which lets us understand how observations relate and
sometimes guess what might happen in the future

## Areas to cover

These are the biggest themes in data science with 

- Programming
- Math 
- Modeling techniques
- Problem solving skills
- Understand the applied domain 

Addition topics that are directly/indirectly related

- Systems/Networking
- DevOps
- Servers/ Cloud services


## Where to start

First stage is learning to use the following

- Programming
    - Python (Just use python)
    - Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow (or alternative)
    - SQL
    - Object Oriented Programming 
    - Data Structures and Algorithms 

- Math 
    - Linear Algebra
    - Up to Multivariable Calculus
    - Probablity and Statistics

- Modeling
    - Linear Regression
    - Neural Networks
    - Gradient Descent


## Next steps 

- Tools
    - Github
    - Git
    - AWS (alternative)
    - Client/Server Protocal

- Programming
    - Learning more languages to get a wider breathe

- Models 
    - review/understand a bunch of different model technique. 

Get better at math is a good tip
